    "This notebook provides a guide to specyfing neural interconnections and designing networks using Hodgkin-Huxley and NeuroDyn models in Python environment. We first start with an overview of two main types of neural interconnections: gap junctions and synapses, and how to implement them in the software environment. The environment allows defining arbitrary conductance-based models of synapses, and we give an example here using an excitatory AMPA synapse. Networks can be constructed using both the standard Hodgkin-Huxley models as well as NeuroDyn neurons, and the notebook shows how we can specify both types. \n",

    "## Overview of neural interconnections\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main types of neural interconnections that we can implement: **gap junctions** and **synaptic connections**. In the conductance-based modelling framework, these interconnections lead to additional currents in the membrane equation of neuron $i$ that are dependent on membrane voltages of other neurons $j$ connected to it:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "C \\dot{V}_i = - I_{int,i} - \\sum_{j} I_{gap, i, j} - \\sum_{j} I_{syn, i, j} + I_{app, i}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $I_{int,i}$ is total internal current of the neuron, $I_{gap, i, j}$ is the current due to the gap junction between neurons $j$ and $i$, $I_{syn, i, j}$ is the synaptic current from neuron $j$, and $I_{app, i}$ is the external current applied to neuron $i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Gap junctions\n",
    "\n",
    "Gap junctions are modeled as simple resistive connections between neurons, so that a resistive connection between neurons $i$ and $j$ leads to a current in neuron $i$:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "I_{gap, i, j} = g_{gap, i, j} (V_i - V_j)\n",

    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "and neuron $j$ receives the same current of the opposite sign.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Synaptic connections\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike gap junctions, synaptic connections are directed connections and are not symmetric. If there is a synapse from neuron $j$ to neuron $i$, then the activity of the *presynaptic* neuron ($j$) modulates the activity of the *postsynaptic* neuron ($i$). Synaptic currents have a similar form to the internal ionic currents, with the difference that their activation depends on the activity of the presynaptic neuron. This is observed in the dependency of the opening rate $\\alpha_r$ on the presynaptic neuron voltage $V_j$:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "I_{syn, i, j} = \\bar{g}_{syn, i, j} r (V_i - E_{syn}) \\\\\n",

    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "The opening of the channels $\\alpha_r$ depends on the presynaptic neuron's voltage $V_j$, while the closing depends on the postsynaptic neuron's voltage $V_i$ (sometimes this relationship is modeled as constant, so that $\\beta_r = const$).\n",
    "\n",
    "The reversal potential of the synapse $E_{syn}$ determines if the synapse is *excitatory* or *inhibitory*: excitatory synapses tend to increase the postsynaptic neuron's voltage, while the inhibitory synapses act to decrease the postynaptic voltage. On the other hand, dynamics of activation $r$ determines the timescale of the synaptic current, i.e. how fast it activates in relation to the changes in the presynaptic neuron."

The arguments of the network are a full list of the individual neural objects, a conductance matrix defining the gap junction connections, and a synapse matrix defining the synapse connections of the circuit. Using the `NeuronalNetwork` class we can define arbitrary neural networks given by the structure of the gap junction and synapse matrices.\n",

    "The NeuroDyn hardware however has a fixed structure: a single **NeuroDyn board** consists of **4 neurons** with **12 synapses** defining a network of four fully-connected neurons. The class `NeuroDynBoard` defines a network with this particular architecture, allowing in addition to optionally connect neurons with resistive connections.\n",

    "By connecting four NeuroDyn boards in parallel through resistive connections, we get a **NeuroCube**. The NeuroCube consists of four NeuroDyn boards stacked on top of each other, so that Neuron 1 of each board can be connected to corresponding Neuron 1 of every other board, Neuron 2 of every board can be connected to every correspodning Neuron 2, and so on, giving in total 24 additional resistive connections that can be controlled. This network is represented by the `NeuroCube` class.\n",
